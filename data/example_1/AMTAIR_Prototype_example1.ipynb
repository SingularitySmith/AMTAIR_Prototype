        "\n",
        "2. **Connect to GitHub Repository & Load Data files**: Run Section 0.2 to establish connections to the data repository and load example datasets. This step retrieves sample ArgDown files and extracted data for demonstration.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Process Source Documents to ArgDown**: Sections 1.0-1.8 demonstrate the extraction of argument structures from source documents (such as PDFs) into ArgDown format, a markdown-like notation for structured arguments.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Convert ArgDown to BayesDown**: Sections 2.0-2.3 handle the transformation of ArgDown files into BayesDown format, which incorporates probabilistic information into the argument structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Extract Data into Structured Format**: Section 3.0 processes BayesDown format into structured database entries (CSV) that can be used for analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Create and Analyze Bayesian Networks**: Section 4.0 demonstrates how to build Bayesian networks from the extracted data and provides tools for analyzing risk pathways.\n",
