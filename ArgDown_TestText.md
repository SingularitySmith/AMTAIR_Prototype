# Main Argument: Current AI as Existential Risk Factor

<AI_Existential_Risk_Factor>: Current and near-term AI technologies can contribute to existential risk by acting as intermediate risk factors.
  + <AI_Intermediate_Factor>: Current and near-term AI technologies can act as intermediate risk factors, magnifying the likelihood of previously identified sources of existential risk.
  + <Risk_Not_Limited_To_AGI>: This potential contribution to existential risk is not limited to the unaligned AGI scenario.
  + <Causal_Pathways_Exist>: There exist causal pathways from AI systems to existential risks that do not presuppose hypothetical future AI capabilities.
